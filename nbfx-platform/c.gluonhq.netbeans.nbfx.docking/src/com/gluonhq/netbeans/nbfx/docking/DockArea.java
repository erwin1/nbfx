/**
 * A docking area: the region of a window in which <em>panes</em> are arranged, and rearranged by
 * dragging the components they hold around. A pane is any {@link Node} of the host's choosing (the
 * type parameter {@code N}) that holds components which can be moved from one pane to another: a tab
 * pane holding tabs, an accordion holding titled panes, a box holding tool windows... The area holds a
 * set of <em>permanent</em> panes, each known by a role name (say {@code NAVIGATOR} and
 * {@code MAIN}), and any number of <em>docked</em> panes created on demand.
 * <p>
 * Its content is a tree whose leaves are the panes and whose inner nodes are {@link SplitPane}s, in
 * either orientation, nested to any depth - or a single pane, when it is the only one left. The
 * shape of the tree, without the panes' content, is a {@link DockTree}; {@link #tree()} reads it,
 * {@link #applyTree} rebuilds the area to it (to restore a persisted layout), and
 * {@link #printTree()} prints it.
 *
 * <p>Some shapes, as {@link #printTree()} shows them:

 * <p>
 * Panes come and go with their components, so the area shows no empty one but the main pane. A docked
 * pane exists only while it holds a component: it is created when one is dropped on an edge (or a
 * persisted layout puts one there) and removed - collapsing the split it was in - once its last
 * component leaves. A permanent pane leaves the area while it is empty and other panes remain, and
 * comes back where it was as soon as it receives a component again. The main pane is the exception:
 * like the editor area in NetBeans it never hides nor moves - emptied by closing, floating or moving
 * its components away it stays, empty, as on a fresh start, rather than letting the other panes fill
 * its place; but if a docked pane sits next to it in its split - directly, or as the nearest leaf of
 * a nested split - that pane's components move into it and the docked pane goes (the main pane
 * taking its slot in the nested split), the way an emptied editor mode gives way to its neighbour.
 * <p>
 * The area never looks inside a pane: the panes come from the {@link DockHost}, which also tells
 * when one is empty and moves the components of one pane into another, and the area only arranges
 * them. Drags are the host's business too: it asks {@link #dropTargetAt} where a drag hovering one of
 * the panes would dock, shows it with {@link #showDropLine}, and on the drop either
 * {@linkplain #split(DropTarget) splits} a new pane there and moves the component into it or, when
 * the component is the last of its pane, {@linkplain #relocate relocates} that pane.
 * <p>
 * A pane other than the main one can also be <em>minimized</em>: taken out of the area, with its
 * components, while the host shows it some other way - as a bar of buttons along the window's edge
 * that slides the components in on demand, the way NetBeans minimizes a window group to a sliding
 * side - and {@linkplain #restore put back} where it was later. {@link #minimizedPanes()} lists the
 * minimized panes for the host to follow, and {@link #anchorOf} tells where each one goes back.
 * <p>
 * A pane can also be <em>maximized</em>: shown alone, the rest of the shape set aside with its panes
 * until {@link #unmaximize()} puts it back - around whatever the area shows by then, so panes docked
 * next to the maximized one meanwhile keep their place in the restored shape. Any change to the
 * shape - a pane docked, moved, created along a side - restores it first, as in NetBeans, so the
 * change applies to the whole layout; {@link #maximizedPaneProperty()} tells when that happens.
