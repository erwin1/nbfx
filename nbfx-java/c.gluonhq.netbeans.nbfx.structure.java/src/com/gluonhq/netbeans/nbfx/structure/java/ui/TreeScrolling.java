/**
 * Brings a tree row into view with the least scrolling, unlike {@link TreeView#scrollTo}, which pins
 * the row to the top: a row already in the viewport is left where it is, one above it comes to the
 * top edge, one below it to the bottom edge.
 * <p>
 * Every step runs in a pulse of its own and never forces a layout: the rows may have just been
 * replaced, and the flow's cells and cell count only follow in the tree's layout pass, so acting on
 * the flow before that pass has run works on stale cells. A row below the viewport is first placed
 * at the top, then - once its cell has a size - pushed to the bottom edge, and a last pass settles
 * what the horizontal scroll bar appearing in between may still hide. A step is skipped when the
 * selection has moved on to another row.
